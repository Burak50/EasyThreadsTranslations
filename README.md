If you add a completely new Language or help a lot with Translation you can request the Translator role in our Discord Server!

# What to Translate?
"thisisanexample": "ThisIsAnExample2"
Please DO NOT translate "thisisanexample", only translate "ThisIsAnExample2". There are also other things you shouldn't translate:
(bracket1) [bracket2] {bracket3} are variables, please don't translate those! BUT at the help Page in the Help_Bot_Variables you are allowed to translate the (threadmessage) bracked for the {usermention} variable.
In <those "brackets"> are Timestamps. Please don't change them. Of course you can add your credits in (thisbrackets) at "selectlanguage_credits" like: "(transladed by YourName#0001)"
