# What to Translate?
> "thisisanexample": "ThisIsAnExample2"

Please **do not** translate "thisisanexample", **only translate** "ThisIsAnExample2".

**There are also other things you shouldn't translate:**
> `(bracket1) [bracket2] {bracket3}` 

Are variables, please **don't** translate those! 

But at the help Page in the <u>help_bot_variables</u> you are allowed to translate the "(threadmessage)" bracked for the {usermention} variable. 

In <those "brackets"> are Timestamps. Please **don't** change them. Of course you can add your credits in <u>(thisbrackets)</u> at "selectlanguage_credits" like: "*(transladed by SpaceDev#0001)*"
